# Price Transparency in Healthcare

Healthcare price transparency is noted to be one of the most effective ways healthcare prices can be kept in check or even lowered. [1](http://www.rwjf.org/en/library/research/2016/03/how-price-transparency-controls-health-care-cost.html) 

To do this we need to collect data from patients (anonymously) and provide this data on an easy to use platform to shop for the quality healthcare.

Data:
  - Provider
  - Hospital
  - Insurer
  - Procedure
  - Cost
  - Reimbursement of Insurer
  - Quality ratings
  
This data can be also provided as an api for other apps to use the data for other purposes.

This can be a non-profit venture.

There needs to be an incentive for patients to share this information from their medical bills.

There will also be features to search for procedures based on price, location, quality, or multiple parameters.

maybe provide a easy way to extract prices from medical bills with an upload feature?

price comparrison tools?
